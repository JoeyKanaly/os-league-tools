Any tasks listed on the website are still from the last league and are not the official list for Leagues 4. We'll update the lists as soon as we have the info.</p> <p>Have fun theorycrafting, see you on launch day!</p>"

Soon you will be able to sync your leagues to-do list with the plugin and view your planned tasks in the client sidebar while you play.</p> <p>We've got a ton of other things in store too, like multiple character support, and a stats tracker to see your daily average point gain and other personal league statistics. To take full advantage of all these new features, you will need to sign up for an OS League Tools account. Just click on the Login link in the top right to get started.</p> <p>We're working hard to get everything else ready for the Shattered Relics launch on Jan 19th, and hope to see you there. Until then, happy scaping!</p>"
